Description: The odeqtmdl R package includes data tables of Oregon Total Maximum 
             Daily Load (TMDL) information and a set of functions that assist in 
             assessment of water quality data against select TMDL targets. 
             This data set is designed to be used for regulatory purposes by DEQ 
             to prioritize, plan, and implement TMDLs, Water Quality Management 
             Plans (WQMPs), water quality restoration activities, and as an 
             information source for permitting NPDES point sources dischargers. 
             The data set is available to the public as a reference. The 
             information and data are provided with the understanding that 
             conclusions drawn from such information are the responsibility of 
             the user. The TMDL documents represent the official record should 
             any information in this data conflict with the approved TMDL or 
             WQMP documents. TMDLs developed by tribal governments are not 
             included in this data.
