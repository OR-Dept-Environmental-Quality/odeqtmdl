#' Export TMDLs to a ESRI geodatabase feature
#'
#' Export active TMDLs from the TMDL reach database to a geodatabase (.gdb). This allows the data to
#' be viewed spatially in a GIS. The TMDL database is an inventory where non-tribal
#' Oregon TMDLs have been developed. The output does not includes TMDLs that have been rescinded or replaced with newer TMDLs.
#' Note the inventory is still being developed and some information may not be accurate.
#' See each relevant TMDL document for more information and applicability.
#'
#' The TMDL database is georeferenced to the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD).
#' The NHD field attributes corresponds to NHDH_OR_931v220, which is the current
#' version used for DEQ business data. Oregon's Assessment Unit fields are current as of 03-30-2022.
#'
#' Output Geodatabase feature fields include:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item action_id:	EPA ATTAINS Action ID assigned to each TMDL document.
#'   \item TMDL_name:	Name of TMDL document and abbreviated citation of TMDL.
#'   \item TMDL_parameter:	Name of the water quality limited 303(d) parameter that the TMDL addresses.
#'   \item TMDL_pollutant:	Name of TMDL pollutant causing the water quality impairment.
#'   \item TMDL_status: Status of TMDL for the parameter and pollutant.
#'   \itemize{
#'        \item Active: TMDL has been approved by EPA and is active.
#'        \item Not Active: TMDL has been withdrawn, disapproved by EPA, and/or replaced with a newer TMDL.
#'        \item In Development: TMDL is in development.
#'   }
#'   \item TMDL_scope: Provides information about how the TMDL applies.
#'      \itemize{
#'      \item TMDL:	Identifies segments that a TMDL was developed for.
#'      \item Allocation only: Identifies segments where a TMDL allocation applies
#'                            but the TMDL does not address a 303(d) listing in that segment.
#'                            Typically this situation is applicable for tributaries or canals
#'                            that are upstream of the segment where the "TMDL" applies.
#'                            The pollutant reduction in the upstream segment is needed to achieve the
#'                            TMDL loading capacity of the downstream segment.
#'                            This is common for TMDLs that address narrative water quality standards
#'                            or cases when the pollutant is not the same as the listed parameter (e.g. nutrients).
#'      \item Advisory allocation: Identifies segments that have suggested non regulatory allocations;
#'                                or segments that may be used to assess progress or status of allocation attainment
#'                                but the segment is not the regulatory compliance point as defined in the TMDL.
#'                                }
#'   \item Period: Identifies the fish use period TMDLs for temperature or dissolved oxygen address.
#'      \itemize{
#'      \item year_round: TMDL developed to address only non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
#'      \item spawning: TMDL developed to address only spawning uses for the temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
#'      \item Both: TMDL developed to address both spawning and non spawning (year round) uses for temperature or dissolved oxygen water quality standards.
#'      }
#'   \item geo_id: Unique ID assigned to the NHD reaches where a TMDL target applies. ID is structured as YearTMDLissued_ShortTMDLdocName_TargetGeoArea.
#'   \item citation_abbreviated: Abbreviated citation of TMDL document using DEQ style guidelines (Chicago Manual of Style).
#'   \item citation_full: Full citation of TMDL document using DEQ style guidelines (Chicago Manual of Style).
#'   \item HUC6: Basin six digit USGS hydrological unit code.
#'   \item HUC6_Name: USGS Basin name.
#'   \item HUC6_full: Concatenation of the HUC_6 and HU_6_NAME fields.
#'   \item HUC8: Subbasin six digit USGS hydrological unit code.
#'   \item HUC8_Name: USGS Subbasin name.
#'   \item HUC8_full: Concatenation of the HUC_8 and HU_8_NAME fields.
#'   \item GLOBALID: Unique ID for every NHD reach record. Used for joins with TMDL GIS features.
#'   \item Permanent_Identifier: NHD Permanent Identifier.
#'   \item ReachCode: NHD Reach code.
#'   \item WBArea_Permanent_Identifier: NHD Waterbody feature Permanent Identifier
#'   \item FType: Three-digit integer value; unique identifier of a feature type.
#'   \item GNIS_Name: Proper name, specific term, or expression by which a particular geographic entity is known
#'   \item GNIS_ID: Unique identifier assigned by GNIS, length 10.
#'   \item AU_ID:	Assessment Unit ID.
#'   \item AU_Name: Name of the assessment unit.
#'   \item AU_Description: Assessment unit descriptions.
#'   \item AU_WBType: Assessment unit waterbody type code
#'   \item AU_GNIS_Name: Assessment unit and GNIS name concatenation.
#'   \item AU_GNIS: Same as GNIS name but with a few additional names not in NHD.
#'   \item LengthKM: Length of linear feature based on Albers Equal Area.
