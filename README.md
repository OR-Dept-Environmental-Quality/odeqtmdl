# odeqtmdl

The odeqtmdl R package includes data tables of Oregon TMDL information and 
a set of functions that assist in assessment of water quality data against 
select TMDL targets. The TMDL information is still being assembled and is 
undergoing review. Some information may not be accurate or complete.
TMDLs developed by tribal governments are not included at this time. See 
each relevant TMDL document for the official record.

## Install

```R
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("OR-Dept-Environmental-Quality/odeqtmdl",
                         host = "https://api.github.com",
                         dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE, upgrade = FALSE)
```

## Data Table Usage

A listing of TMDL actions in Oregon.
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_actions
```

The NHD reaches where TMDLs have been developed.
Note this table is large and may take a minute to load.
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_reaches()
```

The Oregon assessment units and unique stream name (GNIS) watershed assessment units 
where TMDLs have been developed. 
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_au
odeqtmdl::tmdl_au_gnis
```

Summary of all unique 303(d) water quality limited parameter and pollutant pair 
combinations for each TMDL action.
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_parameters
```

The beneficial uses impacted by the water quality parameter addressed by the TMDL
```R
odeqtmdl::TMDL_ben_use
```

Partial inventory of TMDL targets. The table includes 
TMDL target value, target unit, statistical base, season start/end, and the 
geo_id. A geo ID is a unique ID used to identify the applicable NHD 
reaches and Oregon Assessment Unit where the target applies.
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_targets
```

Inventory and narrative description of unique TMDL geo IDs.
```R
odeqtmdl::tmdl_geo_ids
```

Lookup table of DEQ and EPA ATTAINS water quality parameter names and IDs.
```R
odeqtmdl::LU_pollutant
```

There are many other individual package functions. See odeqtmdl package help 
for more information.
